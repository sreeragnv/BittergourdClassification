# BittergourdClassification
Deep learning based classification of bitter gourd into various stages


This project focuses on automating the classification of bitter gourd images into various classes like small, medium, and ripe using deep learning. I employ a comparative approach with various CNN models, including VGG, MobileNet, InceptionNet, U-Net, SegNet, and DenseNet. VGG is known for its simplicity with deep networks and is characterized by using small 3x3 convolutional filters throughout the architecture.MobileNet is designed for mobile and embedded vision applications, featuring a lightweight architecture with depthwise separable convolutions.InceptionNet, or GoogLeNet, is famous for its inception modules, which utilize multiple filter sizes to capture features at various scales in parallel.U-Net is a specialized architecture for semantic segmentation tasks, with a contracting path for feature extraction and an expansive path for precise localization.SegNet is designed for semantic pixel-wise segmentation tasks and uses a decoder-encoder architecture with pooling indices for efficient upsampling.DenseNet is characterized by dense connections between layers, allowing for feature reuse and alleviating the vanishing gradient problem in deep networks.The objective is to identify the most accurate and efficient model for real-world
applications. This research has the potential to enhance bitter gourd quality assessment, contributing to agricultural automation and crop management.
